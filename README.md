## üìö Best practices:

1. **Working with Git:**  
   Follow the git workflow procedure: [guide](https://www.atlassian.com/it/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow)

- **Branch naming**  
  Initiating a task involves creating a new `branch`.  
  Keep the name of the branch short and concise, but make sure to include relevant key words.  
  Use category words to easily identify the type of the task.  
  Keep the same name conventions for the whole project.  
  Adopt the kebab-case style when naming a new branch:  
  `git branch feature/live-chat`

- **Adding new features**  
  Create a new branch starting from the `development` branch:  
  `git checkout development`  
  `git pull origin development`  
  `git checkout -b feature/live-chat development`

- **Commit messages**  
  Make sure to keep your commits small and focused. Use clear and concise commit messages written in the imperative mood, for example:  
  `git commit -m "LIVE-CHAT: Add emoji support in chat message"`

- **Pull request**  
  **Creation:** After pushing changes to your branch, create a pull request for team review.  
  **Naming:** The title should be concise and descriptive.  
  **Description:** Summarize the changes and their necessity.  
  **Review:** Team members review and provide feedback. Address any comments before merging.  
  **Merging:** Merge your pull request into the `development` branch after review. Delete the feature branch afterwards to maintain a clean repository.
